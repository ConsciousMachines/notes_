# Problem 3

## a)

Each $Y_i$ is pointed to by $X, Z_i$. This yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(Y_1 \mid X, Z_1) \\
& f(Y_2 \mid X, Z_2) \\
& f(Y_3 \mid X, Z_3) \\
& f(Y_4 \mid X, Z_4) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Each $Z_i$ is not pointed to by anything. This yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(Z_1) \\
& f(Z_2) \\
& f(Z_3) \\
& f(Z_4) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Likewise, $X$ is not pointed to by anything, this yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(X) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Altogether, this tells us that the joint probability is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(X, Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, Y_4, Z_1, Z_2, Z_3, Z_4) &= f(X) f(Z_1) f(Z_2) f(Z_3) f(Z_4) f(Y_1 \mid X, Z_1) f(Y_2 \mid X, Z_2) f(Y_3 \mid X, Z_3) f(Y_4 \mid X, Z_4) 
\end{aligned}
$$


## b)
 
The Markov property says that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
W \perp \tilde{W} \mid \pi_W
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\pi_W$ are the parents of $W$, and $\tilde{W}$ are all other variables except the parents and descendants of $W$ (Lec 21, slide 11). Now, $X$ is not a parent nor descendant of $Z_j$ for any $j$. Additionally, $Z_j$ is not a parent nor descendant of $X$ for any $j$ (it is a collider). Thus we can substitute $Z_j$ for $W$, and substitute $X$ for $\tilde{W}$ in the above result. Since $Z_j$ has no parents, $\pi_{Z_j}$ is the nullset and we substitute the nullset for $\pi_W$ in the result. This yields $X \perp Z_j$.
