Thanks. My current plan is to build a personal website. On this website I will showcase a few deep learning project to showcase my skills. It will involve a lot of visualization using the D3.js library, so that it can be interesting for people to look at. I think the most interesting topic to cover would be the interpretability of deep learning models. What do you think are some cutting edge projects I could look into that would benefit from this analysis?
Creating a personal website to showcase your deep learning projects is a fantastic idea, and incorporating interactive visualizations with D3.js will definitely make it engaging for visitors. Focusing on the interpretability of deep learning models is a great choice, as it's a topic of significant interest in the field. Here are some cutting-edge projects or areas that you could consider:

Feature visualization techniques:
Implement and visualize various feature visualization techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation, Grad-CAM, and Integrated Gradients. You can apply these techniques to popular deep learning models like CNNs, ResNets, or transformers to help explain their predictions.
Disentangled representation learning:
Create and visualize disentangled representations of data using methods like Î²-VAE, InfoGAN, or FactorVAE. This can help you showcase the underlying structure of the data, and how specific factors of variation can be controlled independently.
Model-agnostic methods:
Implement model-agnostic interpretability techniques like LIME or SHAP, and visualize the results on different deep learning models. By comparing these methods, you can show their strengths and weaknesses in explaining complex model decisions.
Adversarial examples and robustness:
Visualize adversarial examples and the effects of adversarial training on model decision boundaries. This can help demonstrate the vulnerability of deep learning models to carefully crafted adversarial inputs and the importance of model robustness.
Neural architecture search interpretability:
Explore the interpretability of models generated by neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Visualize the architectural choices made by these methods and investigate how they impact model performance and interpretability.
Concept-based interpretability:
Use techniques like TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors) to identify and visualize high-level concepts that are important for model predictions. This will provide a more human-understandable explanation of how the model operates.
When selecting a project, consider your interests, available resources, and the potential impact of the project on your target audience. Remember to provide clear and concise explanations of the techniques used and the insights gained from your visualizations, making your website a valuable resource for visitors. Good luck!

Here are the topics I have learned about:

- Autograd: I have learned about how automatic differentiation works, so I am familiar with how deep learning frameworks like PyTorch work on the inside.

- CNNs: I understand how the pixels of an object in an image propagate through the network and become a classification. Additionally I learned about how the process works backwards, for example with Deep Dream. I can input some noise, and tell the network to make that noise look like a Panda. The network will then use gradient descent to make the noise look like a Panda. Aside from this, I am not familiar with the more recent papers like R-CNN and ResNet, and I am not sure how important they are. 

- VAE and beta-VAE: I played around with some models trained on faces. The results were cool but not too fascinating. I understand the importance of the latent space, I think this is an important area where there has been a lot of improvement. Do you know what are the most influential papers that have to do with latent space representations?

- RNN and LSTM: I did a little bit of work in this area, but as I understand, they have mostly been replaced with Transformers. Is this true? 

- Adversarial examples: I implemented some adversarial examples for a CNN. In the context of images, it is very simple and interpretable. Are there any applications of them outside of images?
